"""What is in a LoRA file, so the app can say what a LoRA will do.

A YuE2 LoRA holds one half of the model, or both.  The planner half sits under
`text_encoders.` and decides what is written: form, harmony, phrasing.  The
decoder half sits under `diffusion_model.` and decides how it sounds: timbre,
production.  ComfyUI's LoraLoader applies them through two separate strengths,
and a strength for a half the file does not contain does nothing at all.

The app's own two LoRAs are one half each, which is why each is applied with the
other strength at zero.  A style LoRA from elsewhere is usually both, and wants
both strengths, so the picker has to know which it is holding.

Reading that costs almost nothing: a safetensors file starts with the length of
its header, then the header itself as JSON, and the tensor names are in there.
