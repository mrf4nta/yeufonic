"""Yeufonic as an MCP server: an agent can ask the app for songs, instrumentals and takes.

Only the part of the Model Context Protocol this needs: JSON-RPC 2.0 over one POST address (the
"streamable HTTP" transport, without sessions or server-sent streams), with the three requests a client makes
to use tools (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`) and `ping`. A tool does what the page does, by
calling the app's own routes, so it has the same checks and the same effect, and a job it starts is an
ordinary take in the library.

It is off until `mcp.enabled` is switched on in Settings: a tool call can queue GPU work, and a client on
the same network could otherwise start it. The Host and cross-site checks the app applies to everything
apply to it too."""
