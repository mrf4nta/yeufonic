"""How much of each song a LoRA trains on, worked out from the card.

The Planner learns each song whole, as one sequence of audio codes (25 a second) after
its style and lyrics, and leaves out a song whose sequence is longer than `max_tokens`.
So songs are cut at some number of minutes.  What limits that number is not the
context, which costs nothing in itself, but preparing the set: the dataset builder
encodes each song whole on the GPU, and the memory it needs grows with the song.

    tokens  = 25 x seconds + the style and lyrics, rounded up to whole 512s
    minutes = (memory the engine could have - the builder's base - a margin) / per minute

The card is read when a corpus is exported and again when its training starts, counting
what the engine holds as available, since it lets go of that first.  TRAIN_MAX_MINUTES and
TRAIN_MAX_TOKENS win when set to numbers, so a card that runs out of memory can be given less.

`BUILDER_*` are provisional: one measurement (a build of songs up to 5:54 used about
13.9 GB of a 16 GB card, the engine at rest holding 8.6 GB) fitted to a straight line.
Two builds at different cuts would replace them.
