"""Instrumentals: YuE2 with a LoRA that plans and plays a song with no vocal.

Where a song has lyrics, an instrumental has a structure, in one of three forms
the LoRA was trained on:

    [instrumental]                         YuE2 chooses the sections
    [intro] [verse] [chorus] ...           you choose the sections, YuE2 the lengths
    [intro 0:00-0:15] [verse 0:15-0:45]    you choose both

The LoRA adapts the language model only, so it is loaded on the CLIP side, for
the plan and for the render alike."""

# There was a Feel control that loosened it to 0.8, then 0.9, for more movement
# between sections. Measured at real song lengths, any loosening lets the vocal
# back in: at two minutes, 0.90 sang through 94%, 94% and 66% of three renders,
# and 0.95 through 15% of one, while full strength was clean on every seed and
# every length tried. An earlier sweep that looked clean had used one-minute
# renders, which are too short to fail this way.
#
# So the control is gone rather than retuned: its only safe setting was the
# default. Movement is still available through Plan variety, Harmony,
# Interpretation and choosing the sections, none of which risk a vocal.
