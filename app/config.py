# 300-500 planner steps over two songs a step, with the score never put in front,
# and their authors picked a checkpoint by ear.  A fixed 600 steps of one song a step,
# whatever the corpus, means many passes over a small one: the planner memorises, and
# the decoder -- conditioned on that drifting planner, with one update a step -- gets
# worse throughout.

# a checkpoint, and never fewer than TRAIN_MIN_STEPS.  TRAIN_STEPS, when set,
# overrides it for every run.

# on too long can be heard back to an earlier step with Checkpoints.

# library the median is about -18 dB; the three renders heard as badly distorted
