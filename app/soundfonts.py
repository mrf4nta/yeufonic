"""The note samples the score preview plays with.

abcjs plays a score by loading one small MP3 per note it needs, from
`<url>/<instrument>-mp3/<note>.mp3`.  The samples are not in the repository: they are
fetched from their upstream home when the person asks for them, and kept in
`data/models/soundfonts`, from where the app serves them to its own page.

The sets are not all the same size, and that is not an error: a piano runs A0 to C8
(88 notes), a clean guitar reaches G7 (89), a voice stops at Gb6 (76) and a bass at
Gb5 (64), because a bass cannot play higher than that.  So a download keeps whatever
the publisher has, a note the set never had is skipped rather than failing the whole
set, and what arrived is written to a small JSON beside it.  That record is what says
the set is here, and how far it can play — the preview shifts a score by whole octaves
to fit inside it, since one missing sample stops a whole playback."""
