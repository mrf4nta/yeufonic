"""Reads one GitHub compare response and says whether a pin is worth moving.

Called by scripts/check-upstream.sh, which fetches the comparison:

    _upstream_report.py comfy   <compare.json> <pin> <repo> [--show-details]
    _upstream_report.py trainer <compare.json> <pin> <repo> [--show-details]

With --show-details, every commit since the pin is listed with its description. For
ComfyUI, the commits that touch the code this app renders through are marked, and
only theirs are described in full: the rest are one line each.

To bump the pin, build the candidate beside the live engine rather than over it:

  1. docker build --build-arg COMFYUI_REF=<new> -t yeufonic-engine:candidate engine/
  2. Run it on another port with the same models mounted, and point a test app at
     it (the test instance conventions are in IDEAS.md).
  3. Render one of each: a cover, a song, an instrumental, and a lyric draft. The
     app reports a mismatched engine by itself, but only those four show that the
     nodes still behave.
  4. Move ARG COMFYUI_REF in engine/Dockerfile, in a commit that says what was
     rendered to check it.
